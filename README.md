`@eyevinn/srt` is a Node.js Native Addon that provides bindings to [Secure Reliable Transport SDK](https://github.com/Haivision/srt).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @eyevinn/srt
```

Installing from NPM downloads and builds SRT SDK and Node.js addon for your operating system Ã— architecture.

### macOS 10.15 Catalina

- [How to fix "cannot link directly with dylib" on libcrypto](#macOS-Catalina-OpenSSL)

## Prerequisites

Please refer to build instructions for your OS of the [SRT project](https://github.com/Haivision/srt#requirements).

This is providing a Node.js binding layer that at its build-time assumes that plain libSRT already *can* be built on your system.

We will merely pull in an SRT codebase from a Git repo here (that may be local or remote), and attempt to compile it (using the specific toolchain and commands invoked for each OS). See [`scripts/build-deps-srt.js`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/node-srt/blob/master/scripts/build-deps-srt.js). Then linking the result of it into the compiled Node.js add-on we provide here via the Gyp tool.

Everything we need on the Node.js side of things (N-API, Gyp) gets installed via NPM,
as you install this package.

However, it is not provided with this any dependencies of building libSRT itself (we only try to invoke the toolchain correctly, whichever it is, on your OS).

As you install all of the prerequisites, or even build the library already in your environment, this package should work also likewise.

### Windows dependencies

For Windows it is a little different: We invoke `vcpkg` to fetch and build all of the dependencies (and therefore assume this to be already installed).

We therefore refer to build instructions of SRT for all steps *prior* to invoking `vcpkg` that need to be performed here likewise: https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/docs/build-win.md#2-preparing-dependencies

## Example

```javascript
import { SRT } from '@eyevinn/srt';
// or const { SRT } = require('@eyevinn/srt');

const srt = new SRT();
const socket = srt.createSocket();
srt.bind(socket, "0.0.0.0", 1234);
srt.listen(socket, 2);
const fd = srt.accept(socket);
if (fd) {
  const chunk = srt.read(fd, 1316);
}
```

## Sync API

The following class `SRT` is implemented in [`src/node-srt.cc`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/node-srt/blob/master/src/node-srt.cc)
and internally returned by [`src/srt.js`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/node-srt/blob/master/src/srt.js)
and which you can get by `import { SRT } from '@eyevinn/srt';`

```typescript
enum SRTResult {
  SRT_ERROR = -1,
  SRT_OK = 0
}
class SRT {
  createSocket(sender: Boolean = false):  Number
  bind(socket: Number, address: String, port: Number):  result: Number
  listen(socket: Number, backlog: Number):  result: Number
  connect(socket: Number, host: String, port: Number):  result: Number
  accept(socket: Number):  SRTFileDescriptor // i.e. a number
  close(socket: Number):  SRTResult // i.e. SRTResult.SRT_OK or SRTResult.SRT_ERROR (0 or -1)
  read(socket: Number, chunkSize: Number):  chunk: Buffer
  write(socket: Number, chunk: Buffer): SRTResult
  setSockFlag(socket: Number, option: Number, value: Number|String|Boolean):  SRTResult
  getSockFlag(socket: Number, option: Number):  SRTResult|Number|String|Boolean
  getSockState(socket: Number):  SRTSockStatus // i.e. a Number; see SRTSockStatus in src/srt-api-enums.ts
  epollCreate():  epid: Number|SRTResult.SRT_ERROR
  epollAddUsock(epid: Number, socket: Number, events: Number):  result: Number
  epollUWait(epid: Number, msTimeOut: Number):  Array<{socket: number, events: number}>
  stats(socket: Number, clear: Boolean):  stats: SRTStats
}
```

### Async API

The N-API binding layer to the SRT SDK is such that every native call are blocking I/O and runs synchronously with the wrapping JS function call. This means that these functions are called from the Node.js proc main-thread / event loop. This creates a throughput limit and in general having blocking operations can impact application performance in an unpredictable way. To address this issue we have an "async variant" of the API where the native blocking calls are put on a JS Worker thread instead (big thanks to @tchakabam for this [contribution](https://github.com/Eyevinn/node-srt/pull/6)). The Async API is a candidate to replace the main API in the next major release. Example with async/await:

```javascript
  import { SRT, AsyncSRT } from '@eyevinn/srt';
  // or const { SRT, AsyncSRT } = require('@eyevinn/srt');

  (async function() {
    const asyncSrt = new AsyncSRT();
    const socket = await asyncSrt.createSocket(false);
    let result = await asyncSrt.bind(socket, "0.0.0.0", 1234);
    result = await asyncSrt.listen(socket, 2);
  })();
```

or with promises:

```javascript
  import { SRT, AsyncSRT } from '@eyevinn/srt';
  // or const { SRT, AsyncSRT } = require('@eyevinn/srt');
  const asyncSrt = new AsyncSRT();

  let mySocket;
  asyncSrt.createSocket(false)
    .catch((err) => console.error(err))
    .then((result) => {
      mySocket = result;
      return result;
    })
    .then((socket) => asyncSrt.bind(socket, "0.0.0.0", 1234))
    .then((result) => {
      if (result !== 0) {
        throw new Error('Failed bind');
      }
      return asyncSrt.listen(mySocket, 2);
    })
    .then((result) => {
      if (!result) {
        console.log("Listen success");
      } else {
        throw new Error('SRT listen error: ' + result);
      }
    });
```

### High-performance read/write use-cases & server/multi-connection implementation

In order to perform on certain use-cases where larger chunks of data split into packets
would need to be sent/received in bursts, we provide "modes" and a high-level class called `AsyncReaderWriter`, which can be initialized an existing `AsyncSRT` instance, i.e a worker thread, and a given SRT socket identifier. It therefore allows to plug-into any concept of a
connection on either side. A client connection instance can therefore just be a socket created
with a successful connection state via the SRT API, and then using the reader-writer for
any sort of transmission upon it.

Also, we provide a class to allow building a server that can accept multiple incoming connections (`SRTServer` and its friend `SRTConnection`). The latter server-side connection object has the method `SRTConnection#getReaderWriter()` to allow using the reader-writer
in order to communicate with the respective client.

The best example to see all this in action at once is taking a look at the respective integration test(s).

These components also all have JSdoc annotations that should help with their usage.

### Readable Stream
A custom readable stream API is also available, example (in listener mode):

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { SRTReadStream } from '@eyevinn/srt';
// or
//const fs = require('fs');
//const { SRTReadStream } = require('@eyevinn/srt');
const dest = fs.createWriteStream('./output');

const srt = new SRTReadStream('0.0.0.0', 1234);
srt.listen(readStream => {
  readStream.pipe(dest);
});
```

or in caller mode:

```javascript
const srt = new SRTReadStream('127.0.0.1', 1234);
srt.connect(readStream => {
  readStream.pipe(dest);
});
```

### Writable Stream

Example of a writable stream

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { SRTWriteStream } from '@eyevinn/srt';
// or
//const fs = require('fs');
//const { SRTWriteStream } = require('@eyevinn/srt');
const source = fs.createReadStream('./input');

const srt = new SRTWriteStream('127.0.0.1', 1234);
srt.connect(writeStream => {
  source.pipe(writeStream);
});
```

### macOS Catalina & OpenSSL

On macOS 10.15 (but not on prior versions), if your OpenSSL system install points to the one from the XCode SDK (which is usually the case), you will encounter:

```
ld: cannot link directly with dylib/framework, your binary is not an allowed client of /usr/lib/libcrypto.dylib for architecture x86_64
```

#### Fix

Step 1) Install/Upgrade to latest OpenSSL: `brew install openssl` or `brew upgrade openssl` if already installed (or install any free-speech OpenSSL distro to your system somehow, using Homebrew here is an example).

Step 2) Set in your environment: `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"`. Adapt the path should it differ on your setup where your free-speech OpenSSL is installed.

#### Explanation

This is due to novel Apple policy for the usage of some of the developer libraries. You can therefore not use these libraries to link with this build.

It is likely you have already an actual free distribution of OpenSSL installed, for example via Homebrew. Still in this case you may encounter this issue with v1.1, while with v1.0 (until a certain patch) it seems that the linkage performed by `brew` install actually prevails the one of the Apple binaries here. However, with v1.1, this is not the case anymore.

Fixing this dependency by *downgrading* to an older implememtation is for obvious security concerns *not* recommendable.

Our recommended fix here will simply have the SRT build system be pointed to where your non-Apple OpenSSL install lives, and use that.
